I have tried my best in coding up this program. Although I did not finish programming for all the requirements and may not know how to program the computer
as the opponent yet, I am willing to try my best to learn and to apply anything I learn to the job position. Thank you for the opporunity you have given me
in testing my programming ability and your time in evaluating my program.
